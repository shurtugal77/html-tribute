      <p>
        After the success of the contemporary Star Trek feature films, a new Star Trek television series featuring a new cast was announced on October 10, 1986.[1] Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry named Picard for (one or both of) the twin brothers Auguste Piccard and Jean Piccard, 20th-century Swiss scientists.[2][3]

        Patrick Stewart, who has a background in live theater at the Royal Shakespeare Company,[4] was initially considered for the role of Data.[5] In the early 1970s, UCSB professor Homer Swander had recruited Stewart to help teach American college students about William Shakespeare.[6] It was because of this connection that in 1986, Stewart was visiting UCLA to assist professor David Rodes with a series of public lectures on Shakespeare.[6] At one of those lectures, producer Robert H. Justman immediately recognized that Stewart was the ideal candidate for Picard.[6]

        Roddenberry originally did not want to cast Stewart as Picard, since he had envisioned an actor who was "masculine, virile, and had a lot of hair".[7] Roddenberry's first choice was Stephen Macht, and it took "weeks of discussion" with Justman, Rick Berman, and the casting director to convince him that "Stewart was the one they had been looking for to sit in the captain's chair"; Roddenberry agreed after auditioning every other candidate for the role.[7][8] The other actors considered included Yaphet Kotto, Patrick Bauchau, Roy Thinnes and Mitchell Ryan.[9] Kotto turned down the role as he was concerned about shifting his career over to television after having a prolific film career; he would later regret the decision, calling it a "wrong decision".[10] Edward James Olmos was also offered the role, but he declined as he wasn't interested.[11]

        Stewart was uncertain why the producers would cast "a middle-aged bald English Shakespearean actor" as captain of the Enterprise.[12] He had his toupee delivered from London to meet with Paramount executives, but Roddenberry ordered Stewart to remove the "awful looking" hairpiece. Stewart's stentorian voice impressed the executives, who immediately approved the casting.[7] Roddenberry sent Stewart C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels, saying the Picard character was based on Hornblower,[13] but Stewart was already familiar with the character, having read the books as a teenager.[14]

        As the series progressed, Stewart exercised more control over the character's development. By the time production began on the first Next Generation film, "it was impossible to tell where Jean-Luc started and Patrick Stewart ended",[13] and by the fourth film, Stewart stated:

        I find myself talking a lot about Picard and one of the things that I've come to understand is that as I talk a lot about Picard what I find is I'm talking about myself. There was a sort of double action that occurred. In one sense, Picard was expanding like this and at the same time he was also growing closer and closer to me as well and, in some respect, I suppose even had some influence on me. I became a better listener than I ever had been as a result of playing Jean-Luc Picard because it was one of the things that he does terrifically well.[14]
